# Products Feature

Provides the administrator console for managing catalog entries. The page loads the current `/api/products` collection, allows
privileged users to create new items, surfaces a compact inventory overview table, and integrates with MinIO-backed image uploads
via `/api/products/images/upload` before persisting new or edited products.
